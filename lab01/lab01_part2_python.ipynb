    "So far, we have covered the bash basics. This gives you enough information to be able to get around in these notebooks, as well as on the command line (particularly when you complete the homework task). Now, we are going to have a look at python - a different programming language and one that we will be focusing on heavily in the first half of the course.\n",

    "You can do a lot of things with python, as it is a very powerful langauge. Python comes pre-built with base library, which are repositories of functions that you can use to do your work. If that doesn't mean much to you right now, it will do as we move on through the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most important thing you need to know about python is that if you want to use any of these functions (and you do, why would you reinvent the wheel?) you need to **import** them first. In the next code chunk, we are going to import a library called **sys** which, as the name suggests, contains many functions that allow you to perform system specific tasks, such as finding your current working directory, or figuring out where your python executable file is. In fact, that's exactly what the code chunk below does."

Python is used the world over for many things, and biology is more of a niche use case. Luckily, the bio community have created a library called **BioPython** that will allow you to access functions that are more applicable to the work that you are doing. And, we have installed it for you!\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, we have specified a string of nucleotides, and we have wrapped it inside a call to `Seq`. `Seq` is a class object - objects have very specific definitions. In this case, it should be obvious that we have taken our string of nucleotides and converted it to an object of type `Seq`. This allows us further access to all functions that `Seq` objects have available to them. We can now access them simply using our variable name, `my_seq`. \n",

We could have done this by hand, but imagine you are working with large FASTA files - you definitely want an easier way of doing this! Now that our sequence has been converted to type `Seq`, we can access the inbuilt functions. One of them is called `complement`.  We store our complemented sequence into a variable called `complemented_seq`\n",
