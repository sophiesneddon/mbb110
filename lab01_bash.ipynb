Blocks can be used to present textual descriptions (like this one), or code chunks (like some you will come across further down). This specific notebook is set to use __bash__ only, but you will come across __python__ and __R__ notebooks later in this lab.\n",

There is another option called __Code__ that will, as the name suggests, let you run that block as code. If you are ever having an issue where you can't figure out why your code isn't running, make sure you haven't got that block set to Markdown. \n",
